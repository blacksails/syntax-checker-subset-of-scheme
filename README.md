syntax-checker-subset-of-scheme
===============================

This was an exercise in a course called Programming Languages, which i followed as part of my computer science study.

We were supposed to write a syntax checker for a subset of scheme. We were given the bnf found in the file scheme-subset.bnf, and were then supposed to write a syntax checker based on that.
